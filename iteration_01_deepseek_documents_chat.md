**Matheus:** I plan on using AI tools to roleplay a mentor and a product owner as well. What changes should I make to that document?

**Deepseek:**
That‚Äôs a fantastic idea! Using AI tools to roleplay a **mentor** and a **product owner** can provide valuable feedback, guidance, and accountability throughout the project. To incorporate this into your **Pre-Project Plan**, we‚Äôll need to adjust the **Stakeholder Analysis** section and potentially add a **Communication Plan** for interacting with the AI tools. Here‚Äôs how you can modify the document:

---

### **Updated Stakeholder Analysis**
We‚Äôll add two new stakeholders: the **AI Mentor** and the **AI Product Owner**. These roles will help guide your development process and ensure the project meets its goals.

  - Help you refine user stories and prioritize features.  
  - Provide feedback on the user experience and functionality.  
  - Ensure the project meets its goals and success metrics.  
- **Communication Plan:**  
  - Weekly check-ins to review progress and adjust priorities.  
  - Use specific prompts to get feedback on features (e.g., ‚ÄúDoes this implementation meet the user story requirements?‚Äù).  
- **Dependencies:**  
  - Clear and specific prompts to ensure useful outputs.  
  - Your ability to incorporate feedback into the project.

---

### **Updated Communication Plan**
To effectively use AI tools as stakeholders, you‚Äôll need a structured communication plan. Here‚Äôs how you can integrate this into your project:

#### **Daily/Weekly Check-Ins**
- **With AI Mentor:**  
  - Discuss technical challenges and progress.  
  - Ask for feedback on code quality and architecture.  
  - Example prompt: ‚ÄúCan you review this Rust function and suggest improvements for error handling?‚Äù  

- **With AI Product Owner:**  
  - Review progress on user stories and features.  
  - Adjust priorities based on feedback.  
  - Example prompt: ‚ÄúDoes this implementation of the habit tracking feature meet the user story requirements?‚Äù

#### **Documentation and Feedback**
- Document all feedback and suggestions from the AI tools.  
- Use this feedback to refine your implementation and improve the project.  
- Example: Create a `feedback.md` file in your repository to track AI suggestions and your responses.

---

### **Updated Risk Assessment**
We‚Äôll add a new risk related to using AI tools and update the mitigation strategies.

1. **Risk:** Over-reliance on AI tools for decision-making.  
   **Mitigation:** Use AI tools as a supplement, not a replacement, for your own critical thinking. Cross-check AI suggestions with documentation and best practices.

2. **Risk:** AI tools may provide inaccurate or incomplete advice.  
   **Mitigation:** Verify AI suggestions with official documentation (e.g., Rust Book, SQLite/PostgreSQL docs). Use multiple AI tools if possible to cross-validate advice.

---

### **Updated Skill Tracking Plan**
We‚Äôll add a new skill related to working with AI tools.

1. **AI Collaboration:**  
   - **Proficiency Level Before:** Beginner  
   - **Proficiency Level After:** Intermediate  
   - **Evidence:**  
     - Effectively used AI tools to guide project development.  
     - Documented and implemented AI feedback to improve the project.

---

### **Updated Timeline**
We‚Äôll add time for regular check-ins with the AI tools.

- **Week 7:** Test, document, and refine the project.  
  - **AI Check-In:** Review final implementation and documentation with both AI tools.

---

### **Updated Next Steps**
1. Set up communication channels with the AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT for Mentor, Claude for Product Owner).  
2. Define specific prompts and templates for check-ins (e.g., ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my progress this week. Can you review and provide feedback?‚Äù).  
3. Create a `feedback.md` file to track AI suggestions and your responses.

---

### **Final Notes**
Using AI tools as stakeholders can significantly enhance your learning and project outcomes. However, it‚Äôs important to maintain a balance between AI guidance and your own critical thinking. Document all interactions and feedback to create a comprehensive record of your progress.

## Two-Week Timeline
### **Week 1: Core Features and Database Integration**
**Day 1‚Äì2: Setup and Basic Task Management**
- Set up the development environment (Rust, SQLite/PostgreSQL).  
- Implement basic task management features:  
  - Add, remove, and view tasks.  
  - Save and load tasks from the database.  
- Write unit tests for core functionality.

**Day 3‚Äì4: Priority Levels and Deadlines**
- Add priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to tasks.  
- Implement deadlines for tasks.  
- Display reminders for overdue tasks.  
- Optimize database queries for filtering and sorting tasks by priority and deadline.

**Day 5: Habit Tracking**
- Implement habit tracking:  
  - Allow users to create habits with a description and frequency (Daily/Weekly).  
  - Link habits to related tasks (e.g., ‚ÄúExercise daily‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúGo for a run‚Äù).  
- Save and load habits from the database.

**Day 6: Integration and Testing**
- Integrate habits with tasks (e.g., suggest tasks based on habits).  
- Write integration tests for task and habit management.  
- Refactor code for readability and maintainability.

### **Week 2: Performance Optimization and Final Touches**
**Day 7‚Äì8: Performance Optimization**
- Optimize database queries using indexing.  
- Implement connection pooling to handle concurrent database access.  
- Benchmark query performance and refine as needed.

**Day 9: Full-Text Search**
- Implement full-text search for tasks and habits using SQLite‚Äôs `FTS5` or PostgreSQL‚Äôs full-text search.  
- Allow users to search tasks and habits by keyword (e.g., `search --keyword "groceries"`).  
- Optimize search performance.

**Day 10‚Äì11: Testing and Documentation**
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all features.  
- Document the project:  
  - Write a detailed README with setup instructions and usage examples.  
  - Document the database schema and API (if applicable).  
  - Include user stories and success metrics.  
- Refactor code for production readiness (e.g., error handling, logging).

**Day 12: Final Refinement and Deployment**
- Perform final testing and bug fixes.  
- Prepare the project for deployment (e.g., package the application, create a release).  
- Share the project on GitHub or another platform for feedback.

## Next Steps
1. Set up communication channels with the AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT for Mentor, Claude for Product Owner).  
2. Define specific prompts and templates for check-ins (e.g., ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my progress this week. Can you review and provide feedback?‚Äù).  
3. Create a `feedback.md` file to track AI suggestions and your responses.

**Notes:**  
This project will serve as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in Rust and database management. I will document my progress and challenges to create a comprehensive learning resource for others.
