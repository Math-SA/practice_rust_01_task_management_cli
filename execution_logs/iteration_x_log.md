## Overview
This project is meant to be developed in a single 2-week iteration. 
---

## Progress
[Summarize what you accomplished during this period. Be specific and include details about tasks completed, milestones reached, and any deliverables created.]

**Example:**  
- Researched microservices architecture and designed the application structure.  
- Set up the development environment (installed Docker, Kubernetes, and necessary libraries).  
- Created a GitHub repository for the project and initialized the codebase.

---

## Challenges
[Describe any challenges you faced during this period. Be specific about the nature of the challenge and its impact on the project.]

**Example:**  
- **Challenge:** Difficulty setting up Kubernetes for the first time.  
  - **Impact:** Delayed the deployment phase by a few days.  
- **Challenge:** Debugging communication between microservices.  
  - **Impact:** Slowed down the integration of backend and frontend components.

## AI Collaboration 
### 1 - Initial design
- **Context:** I needed a small project to guide my studies.
- **Goal:** Use AI to come up with the initial design for the project, ensuring it was aligned with my learning goals.  
- **Result:** After a few rounds of conversation, we arrived at this project's definition, along with gherkin syntax user stories for the project
- **Contribution:** Saved time and ensured the project was aligned with my learning goals in a trackable way.
