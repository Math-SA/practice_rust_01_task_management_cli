# AI Collaboration Log: Rust CLI To-Do List tool

## [2025-01-23]
### Context
I needed a project to guide my study.

### Goal
Get a project definition that would be aligned with my learning goals.

### Prompt
Prompt details at LINK (iteration_01_deepseek_chat.md)

### Implementation
I used the project design and user stories.

### Results
It was able to suggest the design and match it with my learning goals. It was also able to generate user stories using gherkin syntax.

### Reflection
I did achieve the desired results. However, despite being able to produce decent results, the AI failed to complete a task that should have been simple: "repeat this conversation". The AI repeated some interactions and skipped some. Making it clear that any outputs must the checked for errors, no matter how simple.

## [2025-01-25]
### Context
I wanted to test the project driven learning workflow.

### Goal
Get a sample documentation following the workflow

### Prompt
#### Context Priming
I used the project definition from the previous interation, along with the markdown for the template of the documents I wanted it to generate.
#### Follow-up prompts and outputs
Details at LINK

### Implementation
The documents only needed minor adjustments after that.

### Results
I was able to use the generated documents.

### Reflection
The workflow seems to be compatible with current AI models for most part of the document generation.
